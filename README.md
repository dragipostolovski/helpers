## Installation

These functions are theme-agnostic, meaning they can be used in any WordPress theme. To integrate these functions into your theme, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the code**: Copy the functions from this repository into your theme's `functions.php` file. You can paste them at the end of the file or at the appropriate section where custom functions are included.

2. **Ensure proper setup**: Make sure your theme loads functions from the `functions.php` file, which is standard for WordPress themes.

3. **Icons Directory**: If you want to use the `horizon_the_icon` function, create a directory called `/icons/` within your themeâ€™s root directory and add your SVG icons there.

Once integrated, you can use these functions across your theme's templates.
